title: Using components
---

markdown:
  You can use view components in Rails templates by:

  * passing a ViewComponent object to Railsâ€™ <code>render</code>
    method directly
  * using the packaged helpers that build and render the ViewComponent

  The result and functionality of the components is the same
  regardless of approach.

  ## Using component objects directly

  Rails supports the rendering of ViewComponent objects natively, just
  pass them straight to `render` in your template.

.code-sample
  pre
    code.highlight.language-slim
      | = render(GovukComponent::InsetTextComponent.new(text: "Important message"))

markdown:
  ## Using the provided helper methods

  The helper methods make rendering components easier and they
  provide a more consistent experience when using with the
  [link helpers](/helpers/link) and [GOV.UK Form Builder](https://govuk-form-builder.netlify.app/).

.code-sample
  pre
    code.highlight.language-slim
      | = govuk_inset_text(text: "Important message")

== ActionController::Base.render(component_helper_mapping_table)
