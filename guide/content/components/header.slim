  markdown:
    When no arguments are provided to the header itâ€™s rendered with only the
    crown logo and logotype text.

  caption: "Header with custom logo and service name",
  code: header_with_custom_logo_and_service_name) do

  markdown:
    The service name can be set using the `service_name` keyword argument.

    If a custom logo is needed it can be set using the `custom_logo` slot.
    This example uses an emoji but any graphic or text can be used instead.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Header with custom logotype",
  code: header_with_custom_logotype_and_homepage_url) do

  markdown:
    If you want to keep the crown logo but change the text use the `logotype`
    argument.
