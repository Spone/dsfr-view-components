Description:

    Generates the required structure to implement a new component for
    the DSFR.

    It creates the structure for a root component, in opposition to
    nested components like AccordionSection for Accordion â€“ which
    require their own folder and things this generator doesn't handle
    yet.

    The NAME needs to be specified as the first parameter, without the
    component part, so in the example thereafer, Fancy rather than
    FancyComponent.

    Additional parameters for the compoment can be specified with the
    --params switch and should be a list of ARG_NAME:TYPE pairs. The
    ARG_NAME is used as a keyword parameter for the component's
    initialize method, and the TYPE should be a Ruby class/type
    because it will be used to fill in the RDoc comments.

Example:
    bin/rails generate dsfr_component Fancy --params title:String size:Symbol

    This will create:
      app/components/dsfr_component/fancy_component.rb
      guide/content/components/fancy_component.haml
      guide/lib/examples/fancy_component_helpers.rb
      spec/components/dsfr_component/fancy_component_spec.rb
